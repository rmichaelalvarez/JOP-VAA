Authors: R. Michael Alvarez, Joelle Pianzola, Guido Schwerdt, Alexander H. Trechsel, Kristjan Vassil

The included STATA dataset "smartvote_jop.dta" contains information on all individuals surveyed in the pre-election and post-election surveys conducted by the authors before and after the 2011 Swiss federal elections. All variables are labeled and should be self-explanatory. The construction of some variables is discussed in greater detail in the paper.

The replication material also includes the code to produce all empirical results of the paper. All STATA do-files use "smartvote_jop.dta" and must be located in the same folder as the dataset.
1. Executing the STATA do-file "Smartvote_Table_1.do" produces the descriptive statistics displayed in Table 1.
2. Executing the STATA do-file "Smartvote_Table_3.do" produces the regression estimates displayed in Table 3.
3. Executing the STATA do-file "Smartvote_Table_4.do" produces the regression estimates displayed in Table 4.
4. Executing the STATA do-file "Smartvote_Table_5.do" produces the relative likelihoods displayed in Table 5.
5. Executing the STATA do-file "Smartvote_Table_A1.do" produces the descriptive statistics displayed in Table A1.
6. Executing the STATA do-file "Smartvote_Figure_A2.do" produces Figure A.2.
